# Bright Builds Rules

`AGENTS.md` is the entrypoint for repo-local instructions, not the complete Bright Builds Rules specification.

Before plan, review, implementation, or audit work:

1. Read the repo-local instructions in `AGENTS.md`, including any `## Repo-Local Guidance` section and any instructions outside this managed block.
2. Read `AGENTS.bright-builds.md`.
3. Read `standards-overrides.md` when present.
4. Read the pinned canonical standards pages relevant to the task.
5. If you have not done that yet, stop and load those sources before continuing.

Use this routing map when deciding what to load next:

- For repo-specific commands, prerequisites, generated-file ownership, CI-only suites, or recurring workflow facts, use the local `AGENTS.md`, especially `## Repo-Local Guidance`.
- For the Bright Builds default workflow and high-signal cross-cutting rules used in most tasks, use `AGENTS.bright-builds.md`.
- For deliberate repo-specific exceptions to the Bright Builds defaults, use `standards-overrides.md`.
- To choose the right pinned canonical standards page, start with the Bright Builds entrypoint `standards/index.md`.
- For business-logic structure, domain modeling, and functional-core versus imperative-shell decisions, use the canonical page `standards/core/architecture.md`.
- For control flow, naming, function/file size, and readability rules, use the canonical page `standards/core/code-shape.md`.
- For sync, bootstrap, and pre-commit verification rules, use the canonical page `standards/core/verification.md`.
- For unit-test expectations, use the canonical page `standards/core/testing.md`.
- For Rust or TypeScript/JavaScript-specific rules, use the matching canonical page under `standards/languages/`.

- Keep recurring repo-specific workflow facts, commands, and links in a `## Repo-Local Guidance` section elsewhere in this file.
- Record deliberate repo-specific exceptions and override decisions in `standards-overrides.md`.
- If instructions elsewhere in `AGENTS.md` conflict with `AGENTS.bright-builds.md`, follow the repo-local instructions and treat them as an explicit local exception.
